# CPP_Haskell_BinarySearchTrees

Third year university project for the Advanced Software Engineering module

In the first part, I investigate the speed of a BST and other structures in C++ using Big O Notation.  In the second part I investigate a BST in Haskell using Test Driven Development and report on my findings.
